# C-Learning-Project-004---Number-Sorter

# A Note About the Files
There are two attempts at this project contained in this repository. The first one which is comprised of source.cpp and a std lib header file is the first attempt at this project and learning C++. I took a two year hiatus after learning some programming and to refresh myself I worked through my original projects. The revised attempt is that effort.

# Project Notes

Program takes user input and enters the values into a vector. It then goes through and sorts each element in the vector, then prints vector contents to console.
